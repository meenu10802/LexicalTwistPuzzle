# Lexical Twist Puzzle
# 🧩 Lexical Twist Puzzle

## 📌 Overview
Lexical Twist Puzzle is a Java-based interactive word puzzle system designed to improve vocabulary, logical reasoning, and pattern recognition skills.  
The system challenges users with lexical transformations such as word rearrangement, pattern matching, and letter-based logic puzzles.

The project is structured using a **Use Case (UC) driven design approach**, where each UC represents a functional module of the system.

# 🧩 Use Case Details

---

## 🟢 UC1: System Initialization

### 🎯 Object
To initialize and launch the Lexical Twist Puzzle system.

### 📖 Description
This use case is responsible for starting the application. It sets up the execution environment and displays a welcome message to the user. It ensures that the system is ready before any puzzle interaction begins.

### 📌 Outcome
- The system starts successfully without errors
- A welcome message is displayed to the user
- The user is informed that the puzzle system is active and ready

---

## 🟢 UC2: Puzzle Display and User Interaction

### 🎯 Object
To present lexical puzzles and enable user interaction.

### 📖 Description
This use case handles the display of word-based puzzles to the user. It presents scrambled words, letter patterns, or lexical challenges and prompts the user to attempt a solution. This is the main interaction layer between the system and the user.

### 📌 Outcome
- A puzzle is displayed clearly to the user
- The user is prompted to enter their answer
- The system waits for user interaction before proceeding

---

## 🟢 UC3: Input Collection and Validation

### 🎯 Object
To collect and validate user input for puzzle answers.

### 📖 Description
This use case captures the user's response to the puzzle and validates it. It ensures that the input is not empty, is properly formatted, and follows expected rules before further processing.

### 📌 Outcome
- Valid input is accepted for processing
- Invalid or empty input is rejected
- User is prompted again in case of incorrect input

---

## 🟢 UC4: Puzzle Processing Logic

### 🎯 Object
To process the user input based on lexical puzzle rules.

### 📖 Description
This use case applies the core puzzle logic to the user’s input. It may involve operations such as word rearrangement, letter matching, anagram checking, or pattern transformation to determine correctness.

### 📌 Outcome
- User input is processed using puzzle logic
- Internal solution is generated or compared
- System prepares evaluation result

---

## 🟢 UC5: Result Evaluation

### 🎯 Object
To evaluate whether the user’s answer is correct or incorrect.

### 📖 Description
This use case compares the processed user input with the correct solution. It determines whether the user has successfully solved the puzzle and prepares appropriate feedback.

### 📌 Outcome
- Correct or incorrect result is generated
- System determines user performance for the attempt
- Feedback message is prepared for display

---

## 🟢 UC6: Score and Progress Tracking

### 🎯 Object
To track user performance across multiple puzzles.

### 📖 Description
This use case maintains the user’s performance metrics such as score, number of correct answers, and attempts. It helps in tracking progress over multiple puzzle rounds.

### 📌 Outcome
- User score is updated after each attempt
- Progress across puzzles is recorded
- Performance history is maintained during session

---

## 🟢 UC7: Feedback System

### 🎯 Object
To provide meaningful feedback to the user.

### 📖 Description
This use case delivers feedback based on the result evaluation. It informs the user whether their answer is correct or incorrect and may also provide hints or encouragement for improvement.

### 📌 Outcome
- User receives immediate feedback
- Correct answers are acknowledged
- Incorrect answers are explained or flagged

---

## 🟢 UC8: Program Termination

### 🎯 Object
To terminate the system safely and gracefully.

### 📖 Description
This use case ensures that the application ends properly after all puzzles are completed or when the user chooses to exit. It closes resources and provides a closing message.

### 📌 Outcome
- System shuts down safely
- Resources are released properly
- Exit message is displayed to the user
